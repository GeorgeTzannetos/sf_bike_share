# San Francisco Bike Share

> In this repository, I perform the data analysis and modeling of the San Francisco bike share data. The goal is to provide a model that predicts the net change of bikes in each station for the next hour.

> The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share

> The complete analysis is described in source/bike_share_report.ipynb.

> An short overview is given in bike_sharing_challenge_report.
